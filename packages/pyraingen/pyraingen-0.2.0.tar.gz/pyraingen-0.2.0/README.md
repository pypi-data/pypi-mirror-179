# pyraingen

A package for stochastically generating daily and subdaily rainfall with ifd constaining.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install pyraingen
```

## Usage

`pyraingen` can be used to stochastically generate regionalised daily rainfall, disaggregate daily rainfall to subdaily fragments and constrain generated rainfall to observed or predicted Intensity Frequency Duration (IFD) relationships.
The three main functions are:

```python
from pyraingen.regionaliseddailysim import regionaliseddailysim
from pyraingen.regionalisedsubdailysim import regionalisedsubdailysim
from pyraingen.ifdcond import ifdcond
```
