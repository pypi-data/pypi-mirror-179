# Description:



The package is an idea of a decent project I realized based on pytube Package and tkinter and the object-oriented programming, and which was about downloading music, videos, playlists of music and playlists of videos .



I used pytube to code this project and provide a module which can help anyone just by one line of code download whatever he wants from Youtube.

I coded this using a different approach, and I hope that you find it inspiring as I found it.



## Features:



* Download videos from with the maximum resolution up to 720p directly by just providing the link , and the path of your choice for saving the video.

* Download audios directly by just providing the link , and the path of your choice for saving the audio.

* Download Playlists of audios or videos by providing the link of **link of the whole playlist** and also the path of your desire.
