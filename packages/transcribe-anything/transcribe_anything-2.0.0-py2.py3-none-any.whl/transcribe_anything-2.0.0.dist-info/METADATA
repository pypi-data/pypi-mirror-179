# transcribe-anything

Input a local file or url and this service will transcribe it using Whisper AI into subtitle files and raw text.

Uses whisper AI so this is state of the art translation service - completely free. ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯

Version 2.0 is CPU only for now.
Pull requests welcome! Looking for help to getting the gpu accelerated pytorch installations running.

# Usage

```bash
> pip install transcribe-anything
> transcribe_anything <YOUTUBE_URL>
# Outputs the srt, vtt and txt files in YOUTUBE_URL/out.vtt
> transcribe_anything <LOCAL.MP4/MP3/WAV>
# Same but in LOCAL/out.vtt ...
```

## Install dev

Works for Ubuntu/MacOS/Win32(in git-bash)
This will create a virtual environment

```bash
> cd transcribe_anything
> ./install_dev.sh
# Enter the environment:
> source activate.sh
```


The environment is now active and the next step will only install to the local python. If the terminal
is closed then to get back into the environment `cd transcribe_anything` and execute `source activate.sh`

## Required: Install to current python environment
  * `pip install transcribe-anything`
    * The command `transcribe_anything` will magically become available.
  * `transcribe_anything <YOUTUBE_URL> > out_subtitles.txt`
  * -or- `transcribe_anything <MY_LOCAL.MP4/WAV> > out_subtitles.txt`
