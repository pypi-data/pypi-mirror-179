## [1.2.1] - 2022-Nov-30

### Changed

- Remove colorama as a dependency, and simplify how we do "red".

- Change the formatting of context manager checks such that if a msg is included, we see both the message and the assert failure. Previoulsy, the message would replace the assert failure.

## [1.2.0] - 2022-Nov-25

### Added

- Add `any_failures()`. Thank you [@alblasco](https://github.com/alblasco)

## [1.1.3] - 2022-Nov-22

### Fixed

- While using the `check` fixture, allow `check.check` as a context manager.
  - this is unnecessary, the `check` fixture now works as a context manager.
  - but apparently some people have been using `with check.check:`
  - so this fix makes that work.

## [1.1.2] - 2022-Nov-21

### Added

- Allow `raises` from `check` object. 
  - Now `with check.raises(Exception):` works.

## [1.1.1] - 2022-Nov-21

### Changed 

- README update

## [1.1.0] - 2022-Nov-21

### Added

- Red output in pseudo-traceback

### Changed 

- Refactored code into more modules
- All functionality now possible through `check` fixture or `from pytest_check import check`.
  - The `check` object from either of these methods can be used as either a context manager or to access the check helper functions.
- Lots of rewrite in README

### Deprecated
- API change.
  - Access to check helper functions via `import pytest_check as check` is deprecated.
  - It still works, but will be removed in a future version.
  - However, there is no deprecation warning for this.

## [1.0.10] - 2022-09-29

### Fixed

- [issue 80](https://github.com/okken/pytest-check/issues/80) --tb=no should remove tracebacks from xml output

## [1.0.9] - 2022-08-24

### Fixed 

- [issue 55](https://github.com/okken/pytest-check/issues/55) a problem with multiple drive letters.
  - code is using `os.path.relpath()`, but sometimes it can fail.
  - when it does fail, fall back to `os.path.abspath()`.
  - thanks [rloutrel](https://github.com/rloutrel) and [kr1zo](https://github.com/kr1zo) for your patience and persistence, and for the solution. 

## [1.0.8] - 2022-08-24

### Fixed

- Support check failures not blowing up if called outside of a test.
  - should also fix [85](https://github.com/okken/pytest-check/issues/85)
  - thanks [zerocen](https://github.com/zerocen) for the excellent toy example that helped me to get this fixed quickly.

### Changed

- changelog.md format. :)
- tox.ini cleanup
