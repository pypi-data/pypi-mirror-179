The stopwatch can optionally be started automatically by calling `time` instead of `start`, which can streamline usage when polling the time repeatedly.

```shell
pip install stoppy
```

## Usage

Basic usage is as follows:

```python
from time import sleep
from stoppy import Stopwatch

sleep(1)
stopwatch.stop()
print(stopwatch.time())
stopwatch.reset()
```
