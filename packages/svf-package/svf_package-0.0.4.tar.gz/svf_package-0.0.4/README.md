![Build Status](./images/build_passing.svg)

## Support Vector Frontiers package
Support Vector Frontier (see [Valero-Carreras et al., 2022]) (SVF) is a machine learning technique, based on Support Vector Machines (SVM), used for the estimation of production functions.

### Instalation
For installing the package you can use the command:
> **pip install SVF_Package**

SVF Package uses different packages for correct execution:
+ Pandas
+ Docplex
+ Numpy
+ Scikit-learn

### Warning
SVF is an algorithm with a high computational cost. The performance of the algorithm 
largely depends on the amount of inputs and sample size. 

The code has been tested for a ...
