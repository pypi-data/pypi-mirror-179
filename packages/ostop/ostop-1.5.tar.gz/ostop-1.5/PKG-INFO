A Cross-Platform Python implementation of 'top' command using Psutil.

## What top Does

Top is able to get most of the top information with the restrictions that
come with running it at the program level. Different statistics are shown
based on the operating system that this project is run on. top works on
MacOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.

## How to Get Started With top

### PYPI Installation

You can install top through running this command in your terminal:

``` pipx install ostop ```

Once this command finishes running, you can then run commands in
these two different formats:

``` ostop ```

The command with no extra parameters will make the program run
in an infinite loop forever until you close your terminal or
use a Keyboard Interrupt.

``` ostop <integer value> ```

The command with an integer value will make the program run
for the number of iterations/seconds you specify.

### Local Installation

You can get started with top by cloning the repository and running this command:

``` python src/top.py ```

in the base directory. Like the top command, this will run forever.
You can exit out of the program by entering a Keyboard Interrupt or exiting
your terminal altogether. You can also specify the amount of times you want
the program to run by giving an integer input. For example, you can run the
program for one iteration by writing this command:

``` python src/top.py 1 ```

## Running GatorGrade Checks

This repository is able to be automatically assessed using GatorGrade.
These checks can be run from the repository's base directory by running this command
in the base directory if you already have GatorGrade installed:

```gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml```

If you do not have GatorGrade installed yet on your local machine, you can install
it by using this command:

```pip install gatorgrade```

These checks ensure that files are formatted correctly with proficient levels of
polish and also run without crashing. GatorGrade checks are useful both
during and after development.
