Quick start
-----------

You can use glob-linters as a command line tool in a terminal or a workflow in GitHub
action. Choose the appropriate one as a quick start.

Command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use as a command line tool, install the latest package by ``pip`` using the
following command:

.. code-block:: console

        $ pip install glob-linters

After successful installation, you can use glob-linters as a command tool by issuing the
following to see the command line options.

.. code-block:: console

        $ glob_linters -h

Then run :code:`glob_linters` to lint all supported languages in the *current directory*,
which will scan all corresponding files recursively and then perform linting. If you
want to lint particular files, please visit the documentation for more advanced usages.

GitHub action
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use glob-linters in GitHub action, create a workflow file such as
``.github/workflows/glob-linters.yml`` in your own repository with the example
contents:

.. code-block:: yaml

        name: Code linting

        on:
          push:
            branches: ["main"]
          pull_request:
            branches: ["main"]

        jobs:
          glob-linters:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - name: Checkout code
                uses: actions/checkout@v3
                with:
                  fetch-depth: 0

              - name: Linting
                uses: bowentan/glob-linters@v0
                env:
                  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

To use a specific version, replace ``v0``.

You can control the workflow by creating a configuration file named as
``.github/glob-linters.ini`` and a sample configuration is given below:

.. code-block:: ini

        [target]
        dirs = .
        suffixes = .py

        [.py]
        enabled_linters = pylint black isort

        [.py:pylint]
        executable = pylint
        config_file = .github/linter-configs/.pylintrc

        [.py:black]
        executable = black
        config_file = .github/linter-configs/.black

        [env]
        debug = True

This configuration will enable ``debug`` mode with additional information when running
and set the directory that will be searched for linting ``.py`` files to be the
root of your repository, using only ``pylint``, ``black`` and ``isort``.

For more details about usage, please refer to the documentation usage.
