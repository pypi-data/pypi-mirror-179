### Why?

General-purpose servers (e.g. pyls, py-lsp) try to do too much and break stuff
too often for me. Locking Neovim when I press tab, crashes of all kind,
LspRestart failing. Also I like my linting and formatting done by dedicated
tools such as [nvim-lint][nvim-lint] and [formatter][formatter].

[formatter]: https://github.com/mhartington/formatter.nvim

Other Jedi-based servers (e.g. jedi-language-server) seem to focus on coc-nvim
and frequently fail on Neovim's native LSP client for me. I tried to fix
jedi-language-server several times when it failed me but I thought it could be
fun to try pygls to redo it as small and simple as I can. And running a Node
server to get Python completions? No way. That said, jedi-language-server is a
good project and if you're fine with coc-nvim you should definitely check it
out. Lots of the code here is ~~stolen~~ inspired from this project.

### Why the name?

Take the string ‚ÄúIs this a Star Wars reference?‚Äù Language Server, compress it to
`ITASWRLS` and expand it back to Italian Swirls. Italian dishes are made of few
elements that work well together. Enough questions!
