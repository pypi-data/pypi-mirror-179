    'long_description': "# Compose Companion\n\nThis is a little CLI tool created for my home server.\n\nIt aims to make it easy to configure and document scripts that should run before and/or after the server containers on docker compose go up or down.\n\n## Scrips File\n\nThe app will read the scripts from a yaml file in the following format:\n\n```yaml\n# compose-companion.yaml\n\nx-before-up:\n  sonarr:\n    - echo this will run before sonarr startup\n    - echo this too will run before sonarr startup, after the previous one\n  radarr:\n    - echo this will run before radarr startup\n    - echo this too will run before radarr startup, after the previous one\n\nx-after-up:\n  sonarr:\n    - echo this will run after sonarr startup\n    - echo this too will run after sonarr startup, after the previous one\n  radarr:\n    - echo this will run after radarr startup\n    - echo this too will run after radarr startup, after the previous one\n\nx-before-down:\n  sonarr:\n    - echo this will run before sonarr shutdown\n    - echo this too will run before sonarr shutdown, after the previous one\n  radarr:\n    - echo this will run before radarr shutdown\n    - echo this too will run before radarr shutdown, after the previous one\n\nx-after-down:\n  sonarr:\n    - echo this will run after sonarr shutdown\n    - echo this too will run after sonarr shutdown, after the previous one\n  radarr:\n    - echo this will run after radarr shutdown\n    - echo this too will run after radarr shutdown, after the previous one\n```\n\nThe container keys should match the ones from `docker-compose.yaml` file.  \nThe app will look for a file named `compose-companion.yaml` on the folder it's first run, if that's not there it'll ask you to inform the file path manually.  \nAs the top-level keys start with `x-`, you can use the `docker-compose.yaml` file itself, if you wish, and these settings will be properly ignored by docker compose.\n\n## Commands\n\n```plain\n╭─ Commands ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│ config        View or change configurations.                                            │\n│                                                                                         │\n│ down          Shuts down target containers.
