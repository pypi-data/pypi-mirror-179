Route Views requires many tools to support its functionality.
This package is a place for those tools to live.

> Today, this package also acts as the primary 'python programming library' for Route Views.

# CLI Tools

As of today, there are two types of tools provided by this package: monitoring, and automation.

> ℹ The  CLI tools have certain prefix based on tool type:
>
> * `rvm-` is for Monitoring tools that are used only to learn about the running state of Route Views.
> * `routeviews-` is for Automation tools that enable some automated workflow.


## `rvm-latest-mrt` CLI tool

Monitoring tool that shows information about the latest Route Views MRT files (RIB, UPDATE) on a collector.

> Use the `--help` flag to learn more about this tool's abilities.

    $ rvm-latest-mrt
    Latest RIB:    /mnt/storage/bgpdata/2022.08/RIBS/rib.20220802.0800.bz2
    Latest UPDATE: /mnt/storage/bgpdata/2022.08/UPDATES/update.20220802.0800.bz2

## `rvm-bmp-status` CLI tool

Monitoring tool that shows information about BMP connections on a collector.

> Use the `--help` flag to learn more about this tool's abilities.

    $ sudo rvm-bmp-status
    BMP Collector: bmp.routeviews.org
      Connection Uptime: 8 hours
      Data sent: 1.5 GB
      Bytes queued: 2 Bytes

## `routeviews-build-peer` CLI tool

This tool is for (consistently) updating the [Route Views ansible inventory (private repo)](https://github.com/routeviews/infra) when folks submit new peer requests. 

> This tool uses information provided by PeeringDB for the peering information.

### Prerequisites

1. *Route Views Ansible Inventory*: You must have a local copy of the Route Views ansible inventory available, for this tool to update.
    * If you will be running this command with any regularity, is useful to export the `ROUTEVIEWS_INVENTORY` environment variable to point to your local copy of the [Route Views ansible inventory repository (private)](https://github.com/routeviews/infra).
    ```
    # (Optional) Place in your ~/.bashrc
    $ export ROUTEVIEWS_INVENTORY='<working-tree>/ansible/inventory'
    ```
    * `<working-tree>` refers to wherever you've cloned the repository on your filesystem.

### Example: Peer with an ASN using IP Addresses

This tool supports arguments for `asn`, as well as `ip`.
The `ip` argument can be used multiple times to peer with multiple IP Addresses at once.

> ⚠ Only supports peering with one ASN at a time.

> ℹ Use the `--help` flag to learn more about how to use these arguments.

As discussed in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites-1), there is also the `inventory` argument required that points to the "inventory/" directory.

> ℹ Tip: Provide an `asn` and omit the `ip` argument entirely -- the tool will attempt to peer with ALL compatible IP Addresses for the provided `asn`!

    $ routeviews-build-peer \
        --inventory <working-tree>/ansible/inventory \
        --asn 15169 \
        --ip 202.249.2.189 \

### Example: Peer with an ASN (at ALL IXes)

If an ASN is wanting to connect wherever possible, provide only the `asn` argument and the tool will determine all the possible `ip` arguments from PeeringDB.

## `routeviews-email-peers` CLI tool

This tool will get a list of email addresses for any networks that are actively peered with a particular Route Views Collector.
This tool is for gathering email address information about Route Views Collector's peers around the world, leveraging [PeeringDB]() and [RDAP](TODO).

> Future Plan: Use UO SMTP server to automate actually sending *many* types of 'standard Route Views Operations emails' (use Jinja2 Templates for the email templates).

### Prerequisites

1. *SSH Access*: This script uses NetMiko, and assumes that the current user can SSH into the collector using SSH keys (recommend using an `ssh-agent`).
2. *PeeringDB Account (Optional, if you would like this tool to search PeeringDB)*: Export your PeeringDB credentials as environment variables, `PEERINGDB_USERNAME` and `PEERINGDB_PASSWORD`:
    ```
    # (Optional) Place in your ~/.bashrc
    $ export PEERINGDB_USERNAME=rleonar7
    $ export PEERINGDB_PASSWORD=MySuperSecretPassword
    ```
> (non)Anonymous access to PeeringDB API: Unfortunately, PeeringDB APIs only return the info we need when using a PeeringDB account, and not when using anonymous access.

### Example

Run the `routeviews-email-peers` command against a specific Route Views collector, e.g. "route-views4.routeviews.org".

Today, this command will to produce a semicolon-separated list of email addresses for each (established) peering session on that collector.

    $ routeviews-email-peers --collector route-views4.routeviews.org
    > WARNING:root:No email found for ASN: 204028
    > noc@netactuate.com; noc@enetworks.co.za; noc@net.internet2.edu; ... trimmed for brevity...

## YAML Python API

We have a custom YAML module for handling (Ansible) YAML config files.
In particular, this module will handle whitespace matching the standard way used throughout the Route Views Infrastructure repo.
Further, this module ensures that the order data dumped is the same as ingested.

> Today, this functionality comes thanks to the [ruamel.yaml package (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/)!

### Example

This example loads a file by filename, then saves that file back.

> In this case, this will essentially create a copy the "vars.yml" file.
>
> ℹ Tip: The "vars2.yml" copy, or any file dumped using `routeviews.yaml`, will follow the Route Views YAML styling convention.

    import routeviews.yaml

    my_variables = routeviews.yaml.load('vars.yml')

    # ... make updates to `my_variables`...

    routeviews.yaml.dump(my_variables, 'vars2.yml')

## Additional APIs

Besides the CLI tools discussed above, this package contains many internal packages/modules that might be useful.

> ⚠ NOTICE: Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. This public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.

* There is the `routeviews.peeringdb` package that has some great methods for interfacing with the PeeringDB API.
* There is the `routeviews.yaml` module that can load and save YAML config files (without rearranging them).
    * Depends on the [`ruamel.yaml` package](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/)
* There is the `routeviews.ansible` package, that can load, modify, and save the Route Views Ansible Inventory.
* There is the `routeviews.bgpsummery` module, that defines a `BGPSummary` class as well as functions for retrieving a `BGPSummary` from any collector.
* There is the (start of a) `routeviews.api` module/package, for interfacing with the Route Views API/DB (undocumented).








# Release Notes

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

> Notice: Major version "Zero" (0.y.z) is for initial development. Today, anything MAY change with each minor release.

## 0.2.2

* Create a 'GitHub Release' after delivering package to PyPI.org

## 0.2.1

* Add many InfluxDB tags to `rvm-latest-mrt`, and remove 2 fields (that were turned to tags).
    * Using tags enables more useful and efficient querying in Grafana!

## 0.2.0

* Add a set of `rvm` (Route Views Monitor) CLI tools.
    > **ℹ Tip:** The `rvm` tools listed below can run on any FRR-based Route Views collector.
    * `rvm-latest-mrt`: Get metrics about the latest MRT Dump files on a Route Views collector.
    * `rvm-bgp-status`: Get info about BGP Peerings on a Route Views collector.
    * `rvm-bmp-status`: Get info about BMP sessions on a Route Views collector.
* Add `--sudo` flag to CLI tools where appropriate.
    * CLI tools that depend on `vtysh` will only use raise privileges when running `vtysh`.
* Extract 'InfluxDB Line Protocol' logic into `routeviews.influx` module.
    * Generate InfluxDB Line Protocol -- useful when using CLI tools as [Telegraf Exec Input Plugins](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/exec).
* Extract 'TextFSM Template Parsing' logic into the `routeviews.parse.template_parse` function.
    * See additional [discussion of TextFSM in our Design Docs](./design.md#textfsm-conventions)

## 0.1.3

* Fix Bug: `routeviews-build-peer` CLI tool rearranges the 'Route Views Peer Config' in the Ansible Inventory.
    * Now we track the 'order' of attributes whenever loading any `routeviews.ansible.NeighborConfig` class from a YAML file.
    That 'order' is then used when subsequently dumping the data, thus ensuring that nothing is rearranged unnecessarily!

## 0.1.2

* Bug: `routeviews-build-peer` CLI tool rearranges the 'Route Views Peer Config' in the Ansible Inventory.

* Fix PeeringDB Authentication!
    * See the [relevant GitHub Issue](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/1206#issuecomment-1202550667) where we discovered the following details about PeeringDB API Basic Authentication:
    > 1. Do NOT base64 encode
    > 2. Username/Password Must be space-separated (e.g., must not be colon ":" separated)
    > 3. Username when using API tokens is "Api-Key"
    > 4. Ensure "www" is in all API requests!
* Enable using PeeringDB API Key instead of username/password.
    * Exposed via `--peeringdb-key` argument in `routeviews-build-peer` CLI tool (or as env var: `PEERINGDB_KEY`).
* Add the filepath to the exception message when `routeviews.yaml` encounters a `ParseError`.
    * This enables fixing syntax issues very quickly.
    * "Unable to parse `<filepath>`" is the added message, seen below:
    ```
    ... omitted traceback for brevity...
    routeviews.yaml.ParseError: while parsing a block mapping
        in "<unicode string>", line 1, column 1:
            short_name: decix
            ^ (line: 1)
    expected <block end>, but found '-'
        in "<unicode string>", line 109, column 1:
            - peer_as: 8888
            ^ (line: 109)
    Unable to parse <working-tree>/ansible/inventory/host_vars/route-views.decix.routeviews.org
    ```
* Ensure that PyVCR cassettes do not contain HTTP Basic Authentication secrets.
    * Rotated the (randomly generated) Base64 encoded password that was previously exposed via HTTP Basic Authentication Headers. 

## 0.1.1

* Fix Bug: Package failed to declare some critical dependencies. 


## 0.1.0

> Bug: Package failed to declare some critical dependencies. 
> Was missing `uologging` and `raumel.yaml` dependencies deceleration in "setup.py".

The first release of the routeviews package contains some core CLI tools, as well as some functions/classes that might be useful to routeviews maintainers.
