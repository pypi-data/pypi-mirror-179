**This is alpha software** without any guaranteed API stability. The
dask-awkward project is affiliated with awkward-array's v1 to v2
transition. [Read more about that
here](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/wiki). The first official
stable release of dask-awkward is planned for December 2022. We still
encourage willing users to experiment and report issues!
