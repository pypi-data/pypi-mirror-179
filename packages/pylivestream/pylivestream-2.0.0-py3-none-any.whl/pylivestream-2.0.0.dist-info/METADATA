          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.
        
          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

[![PyPi Download stats](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/pylivestream)](https://pepy.tech/project/pylivestream)

Streams to one or **multiple** streaming sites simultaneously, using pure object-oriented Python (no extra packages) and FFmpeg.
Tested with `flake8`, `mypy` type checking and `pytest`.
Python >= 3.9 is recommended for full capabilities.
`visual_tests.py` is a quick check of several command line scripting scenarios on your laptop.
FFmpeg is used from Python `subprocess` to stream to sites including:

* Facebook Live  (requires FFmpeg >= 4.2 due to mandatory RTMPS)
* YouTube Live
* Twitch
* also Ustream, Vimeo, Restream.io and more for streaming broadcasts.

![PyLivestream diagram showing screen capture or camera simultaneously livestreaming to multiple services.](./doc/logo.png)

[Troubleshooting](./Troubleshooting.md)

## PyLivestream benefits

* Python scripts compute good streaming parameters, and emit the command used to copy and paste if desired.
* Works on any OS (Mac, Linux, Windows) and computing platform, including PC, Mac, and Raspberry Pi.
* Uses single JSON file pylivestream.json to adjust parameters.

### PyLivestream limitations

* does *not* auto-restart if network connection glitches
* is intended as a bare minimum command generator to run the FFmpeg program
* is not intended for bidirectional robust streaming--consider a program/system based on Jitsi for that.

### Design rationale

Why not do things without the command line, via linking libffmpeg, libgstreamer or libav?

* the command-line approach does not require a compiler or OS-dependent libraries
* once you get a setup working once, you don't even need Python anymore--just copy and paste the command line

### Alternatives

Other projects using FFmpeg from Python include:

* [python-ffmpeg](https://github.com/jonghwanhyeon/python-ffmpeg) lower level use of FFmpeg with Python asyncio
* [asyncio-subprocess-ffpmeg](https://github.com/scivision/asyncio-subprocess-ffmpeg) simple asyncio subprocess example that could also be used as a template for general asyncio subprocess Python use.
* [ffmpy](https://github.com/Ch00k/ffmpy) FFmpeg subprocess without asyncio

## Install

Requires FFmpeg &ge; 3.0 (&ge; 4.2 for Facebook Live RTMPS)

Latest release:

```sh
python3 -m pip install PyLivestream
```

Development version:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/scivision/PyLivestream

cd PyLivestream

python3 -m pip install -e .
```

## Configuration: pylivestream.json

You can skip past this section to "stream start" if it's confusing.
The defaults might work to get you started.

The pylivestream.json file you create has parameters relevant to the live stream.
We suggest copying the example
[pylivestream.json](./src/pylivestream/data/pylivestream.json)
and editing, then specify it for your streams.

* `screencap_origin`: origin (upper left corner) of screen capture region in pixels.
* `screencap_size`: resolution of screen capture (area to capture, starting from origin)
* `screencap_fps`: frames/sec of screen capture
* `video_kbps`: override automatic video bitrate in kbps
* `audio_rate`: audio sampling frequency. Typically 44100 Hz (CD quality).
* `audio_bps`: audio data rate--**leave blank if you want no audio** (usually used for "file", to make an animated GIF in  post-processing)
* `preset`: `veryfast` or `ultrafast` if CPU not able to keep up.
* `exe`: override path to desired FFmpeg executable. In case you have multiple FFmpeg versions installed (say, from Anaconda Python).

Next are `sys.platform` specific parameters.

Seek help in FFmpeg documentation, try capturing to a file first and then update ~/pylivestream.json for `sys.platform`.

### Deduce inputs

Each computer will need distinct pylivestream.json device input parameters:

* audio_chan: audio device
* camera_chan: camera device
* screen_chan: desktop capture software port name

Loopback devices that let you "record what you hear" are operating system dependent.
You may need to search documentation for your operating system to enable such a virtual loopback device.

#### Windows

```sh
ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy
```

#### MacOS

```sh
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i ""
```

#### Linux

```sh
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
```

## API

There are two ways to start a stream (assuming you've configured as per following sections).
Both do the same thing.

* command line
  * python -m pylivestream.glob
  * python -m pylivestream.screen
  * python -m pylivestream.loopfile
  * python -m pylivestream.screen2disk
  * python -m pylivestream.camera
  * python -m pylivestream.microphone
* `import pylivestream.api as pls` from within your Python script. For more information type `help(pls)` or `help(pls.stream_microphone)`
  * pls.stream_file()
  * pls.stream_microphone()
  * pls.stream_camera()

## Authentication

The program loads a JSON file with the stream URL and hexadecimal stream key for the website(s) used.
The user must specify this JSON file location.

### YouTube Live

1. [configure](https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard) YouTube Live.
2. Edit "pylivestream.json" to have the YouTube streamid
3. Run Python script and chosen input will stream on YouTube Live.

```sh
python -m pylivestream.screen youtube ./pylivestream.json
```

### Facebook Live

Facebook Live requires FFmpeg >= 4.2 due to mandatory RTMPS

1. configure your Facebook Live stream
2. Put [stream ID](https://www.facebook.com/live/create) into the JSON file
3. Run Python script for Facebook with chosen input

```sh
python -m pylivestream.screen facebook ./pylivestream.json
```

### Twitter

TODO

### Twitch

Create stream from
[Twitch Dashboard](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/settings/channel#stream-preferences).
Edit pylivestream.json file with "url" and "streamid" for Twitch.
Run Python script for Twitch with chosen input:

```sh
python -m pylivestream.screen twitch ./pylivestream.json
```

## Usage

Due to the complexity of streaming and the non-specific error codes FFmpeg emits, the default behavior is that if FFmpeg detects one stream has failed, ALL streams will stop streaming and the program ends.

Setup a pylivestream.json for computer and desired parameters.
Copy the provided
[pylivestream.json](./src/pylivestream/data/pylivestream.json)
and edit with values you determine.

[File-Streaming](./File-Streaming.md)

### Camera

Note: your system may not have a camera, particularly if it's a virtual machine.

JSON:

* `camera_size`: camera resolution -- find from `v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext` or camera spec sheet.
* `camera_fps`: camera fps -- found from command above or camera spec sheet

Stream to multiple sites, in this example Facebook Live and YouTube Live simultaneously:

```sh
python -m pylivestream.camera youtube facebook ./pylivestream.json
```

### Screen Share Livestream

Stream to multiple sites, in this example Facebook Live and YouTube Live simultaneously:

```sh
python -m pylivestream.screen youtube facebook ./pylivestream.json
```

### Image + Audio Livestream

Microphone audio + static image is accomplished by

```sh
python -m pylivestream.microphone youtube facebook ./pylivestream.json -image doc/logo.jpg
```

or wherever your image file is.

### Audio-only Livestream

Audio-only streaming is not typically allowed by the Video streaming sites.
It may fail to work altogether, or may fail when one file is done and another starts.
That's not something we can fix within the scope of this project.
You can test it to your own computer by:

```sh
python -m pylivestream.microphone localhost ./pylivestream.json
```

### Screen capture to disk

This script saves your screen capture to a file on your disk:

```sh
python -m pylivestream.screen2disk myvid.avi ./pylivestream.json
```

## Utilities

* `PyLivestream.get_framerate(vidfn)` gives the frames/sec of a video file.
* `PyLivestream.get_resolution(vidfn)` gives the resolution (width x height) of video file.

## Notes

* Linux requires X11, not Wayland (choose at login)
* `x11grab` was deprecated in FFmpeg 3.3, was previously replaced by `xcbgrab`
