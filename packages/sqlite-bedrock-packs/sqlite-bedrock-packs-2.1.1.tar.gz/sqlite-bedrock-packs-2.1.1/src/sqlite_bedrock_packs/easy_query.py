        Creates an instance of :class:`EasyQuery` from the given properties.
        This is a go-to method for creating an instance of :class:`EasyQuery`.

        This function automatically finds the relations in the database to find
        the connections between provided tables. The rows of the results of the

        this function is then passed to the :class:`EasyQuery` constructor.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> query = EasyQuery(
            ...     None, "Entity", Left("Geometry"), "RpAnimation",

                    ON ClientEntityAnimationField.identifier = RpAnimation.identifier

                    EntityFile.EntityFile_pk == 1

        :param db: The database connection or :class:`Database` object. The
            db can be None if you only want to get the query string and don't
            care about running it.
        :param root: The root table to start the query from.
        :param tables: A list of tables to join. Use Left to indicate that a table
            should be joined using LEFT join. The tables don't need to have a
            direct connection between each other, the connections will be found
            automatically if necessary relations exist (this means that the query
            genrated can include tables that are not in the list).
        :param blacklist: A list of tables to ignore while searching for
            connections. By default it's BehaviorPack and ResourcePack because
            otherwise in many cases the query would look for objects from the same
            packs instead of using different more useful connections.
        :param accept_non_pk: Whether to accept non-primary key relations.
            By default it's True. The primary key connections only cover the
            situations where it's guaranteed that the relation is valid (like
            a relation between EntityFile and Entity). Most of the connections
            that might be useful to query are non-primary key connections (like
            a relation between a ClientEntity and RenderController).
        :param distinct: Whether to use DISTINCT in the query. By default it's
            True. It's recommended to use it when querying for multiple tables
            because otherwise the query might return the same row multiple times.
        :param where: A list of constraints to add to the query. This is a
            list of strings with raw SQL code which is inserted into the WHERE
            part of the query. The constraints are joined using AND.
        :param group_by: A list of columns to group the results by. This is a
            list of strings with raw SQL code which is inserted into the GROUP BY
            part of the query.
        :param having: A list of constraints to add to the query. This is a
            list of strings with raw SQL code which is inserted into the HAVING
            part of the query. The constraints are joined using AND.
        :param order_by: A list of columns to order the results by. This is a
            list of strings with raw SQL code which is inserted into the ORDER BY
            part of the query.
