# HGDB RTL
This is an experimental tool to generate symbol table from SystemVerilog designs.
It uses [slang](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang) as a frontend to parse any SystemVerilog files.

## How to install
TO install, simply run the following commands

```
pip install hgdb-rtl
```

`hgdb-rtl` will show up in your path.

## Limitations
Since SystemVerilog is a complex language, there are several limitation in the current implementation.
Notice that none of them are systematic - given enough engineering effort, they can be overcome.

1. No SSA transformation for `always_comb` logic. This means that if you reassign the same variable
   in the same `always_comb` block, the intermediate result will not show in during debugging.
2. Local variables declared in the procedural will not be detected.
