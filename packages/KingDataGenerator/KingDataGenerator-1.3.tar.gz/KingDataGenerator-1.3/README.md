Human Data Generator (Gerador de Dados Humanos)

This library was created based on the functionalities
from 4Devs, I created small functions to filter each data,
which is generated by the "generators" function of the fordev library,
in this way, initially we have names, telephones, e-mails,
passwords, cpfs and cnpjs

USAGE

to use the libraries is very simple, just import
from modules import names
PLAY THE FUNCTION INSIDE A VARIABLE, INFORM HOW MANY VALUES NEED TO BE GENERATED
AND PRINT
<names = names(20)>
All results will be returned within an ARRAY

The only library that has more parameters at the moment is phone_numbers
<phone_n = phone_numbers(20, '(12)')>
You can pass the DD in the second parameter, but by default it is '(11)'
