            Explorer is simple web application for exploring the directory.
            Main objective of explorer is to help the developer to explor the static files
            during the development phase. It allow developer to view, delete and dowload files
            from the application.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            If you deploy your application using docker, then explorer will help you to 
            explore files that are not easily accessible.
        </h5>
        <h5>
            It is always preferable to use explorer in the development environment not
            in production environment.
