`underpants` - Or, using Pants as an embedded rules engine
==========================================================

For Pantsbuild version: 2.14.0

DISCLAIMER: This is not in any way to show how to use Pants, or recommended patterns of
use. Provided here AS-IS. No gurantees of any kind, as this may break with any future release of
Pants.

This is a toy POC testing out the feasability of using the [Pants Build
System](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) as a rule engine in your Python application.

The relative narrow Python interpreter constraint of 3.9.* is due to the combination of Pants ICs of
>=3.7,<3.10 and the fact that for ARM based Mac (M1s) only >=3.9 works with Pants.
