        Changes
        =======
        
        1.6 (2022-12-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Pass ``name`` and ``parent`` as keyword arguments all over the place.
          Preparation for use of ``NodeInit`` behavior instead of ``DefaultInit``.
          [rnix]
        
        
        1.5 (2022-03-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Replace deprecated use of ``Storage`` by ``MappingStorage``.
          [rnix]
        
        - Replace deprecated use of ``Nodify`` by ``MappingNode``.
          [rnix]
        
        - Replace deprecated use of ``Adopt`` by ``MappingAdopt``.
          [rnix]
        
        - Replace deprecated use of ``NodeChildValidate`` by ``MappingConstraints``.
          [rnix]
        
        - Replace deprecated use of ``allow_non_node_childs`` by ``child_constraints``.
          [rnix]
        
        
        1.4 (2021-10-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Implement ``_list_factory`` on ``Podict`` and ``OOBTodict`` and use
          ``PersistentList`` for internal double linked list triples to allow
          transaction property detect changes.
          [rnix, jensens]
        
        - Drop ZODB3.
          [rnix]
        
        
        1.3 (2020-07-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Access ``attrs`` when initializing nodes with ``ZODBAttributes`` behavior
          applied to avoid lazy creation. Needed to prevent ``_p_changed`` being set on
          first access.
          [rnix, 2020-06-23]
        
        - Access ``storage`` when initializing nodes with ``PodictStorage`` or
          ``OOBTodictStorage`` behaviors applied to avoid lazy creation. Needed
          to prevent ``_p_changed`` being set on first access.
          [rnix, 2020-06-23]
        
        - Use ``plumb`` instead of overriding ``__setattr__`` to change ``__parent__``
          name to ``_v_parent`` on ``ZODBBehavior``.
          [rnix, 2020-06-23]
        
        - Use ``plumb`` instead of overriding ``__getitem__`` to set parent on
          ``ZODBBehavior``.
          [rnix, 2020-02-28]
        
        
        1.2 (2017-07-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Add python 3 support.
          [rnix, 2017-06-24]
        
        - Add ``keys`` to ``OOBTodict`` and accept any number of ``*args`` and ``**kw``
          to match expected contract by ``OOBTree`` and Fix tests with ZODB 5.
          [rnix, 2017-06-22]
        
        - Add ``__nonzero__`` and ``__bool__`` to ``OOBTodict`` in order to make it
          work properly with ZODB 5.
          [rnix, 2017-06-22]
        
        - Use ``@property`` and ``@property.setter`` for ``OOBTodict.lh`` and
          ``OOBTodict.lt``.
          [rnix, 2017-06-22]
        
        
        1.1.1
        -----
        
        - Change ``ZODB`` install requirement to ``ZODB3``. Latter one is a meta
          package as of version 3.11.0 and installs ``ZODB``
          [rnix, 2017-06-19]
        
        
        1.1
        ---
        
        - Remove superfluous ``__repr__`` function from ``OOBTodict``. ``odict``
          package properly outputs class name as of version 1.6.2.
          [rnix, 2017-06-14]
        
        - Fix ``volatile_property`` to work on classes overwriting ``__getattr__``.
          [rnix, 2017-06-14]
        
        - Use ``plumbing`` decorator instead of ``__metaclass__`` and ``__plumbing__``
          class attributes.
          [rnix, 2017-06-14]
        
        
        1.0.1
        -----
        
        - Add maintenance utilities.
          [rnix, 2014-05-13]
        
        - Cleanup tests.
          [rnix, 2014-05-13]
        
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        - initial
