Description
===========


Generates a mock visual graph dataset.

This mock dataset is not actually used for any meaningful model training but instead it is supposed to be
easy to understand and small in size, such that it can be used for testing purposes.

The idea of this simple mock dataset is to generate small graphs which only have a single node property
which is a float value which will represent the blackness of the node for visualization. Inside about
half of the graphs an explanatory motif will be embedded which is a triangle of completely black nodes,
which will explain a certain regression value.
