{"description": "\nGenerates a mock visual graph dataset.\n\nThis mock dataset is not actually used for any meaningful model training but instead it is supposed to be\neasy to understand and small in size, such that it can be used for testing purposes.\n\nThe idea of this simple mock dataset is to generate small graphs which only have a single node property\nwhich is a float value which will represent the blackness of the node for visualization. Inside about\nhalf of the graphs an explanatory motif will be embedded which is a triangle of completely black nodes,\nwhich will explain a certain regression value.\n", "start_time": 1670140656.5290833, "path": "/home/jonas/Private/visual_graph_datasets/visual_graph_datasets/experiments/generate_mock/debug", "artifacts": {"source": "/home/jonas/Private/visual_graph_datasets/visual_graph_datasets/experiments/generate_mock.py", "templates": {"analysis.py": "/home/jonas/Private/visual_graph_datasets/visual_graph_datasets/experiments/generate_mock/debug/analysis.py", "annotations.rst": "/home/jonas/Private/visual_graph_datasets/visual_graph_datasets/experiments/generate_mock/debug/annotations.rst"}}, "monitoring": {"1670140656.530268": {"ts": 1670140656.530268, "cpu": 39.8, "memory": {"total": 78.47254180908203, "free": 58.76183319091797}, "storage": {"total": 456.8854446411133, "free": 15.396617889404297}}}, "end_time": 1670140666.0141323, "elapsed_time": 9.48504900932312, "duration": 9.48504900932312}
