# **[->] Nexsys**
An equation solving program written in Rust ðŸ¦€

Nexsys (i**N**tuitive **E**quations, e**X**pressions, and **SYS**tems) is 
inspired by Engineering Equation Solver (EES), which is a program intended 
for engineers working with thermal or fluids-heavy systems. This tool allows 
engineers to develop massive mathematical models of the systems they work with 
and produce optimized designs in less time than it might take to develop the 
same model in Python or Matlab.

The main drawback of EES is its closed-source nature and poor ability to 
integrate with non-Windows machines and other software, so with an interest in 
simulation and computer-aided engineering, I took it upon myself to fill the gap.

# The `nexsys-core` Crate
This is the `nexsys-core` sub-crate, which is responsible for providing 
from-scratch implementations of Newton's method for solving both single-unknown 
equations and nonlinear systems of equations, as well as the Nexsys solver engine. 

The main point of access for the Nexsys solver is the `Nexsys` struct, which 
interprets raw text as a sort of pseudo-code in order to determine what equations 
can and can't be solved and in what order.
