# Proximal Augmented Lagrangian method for Quadratic Programs

QPALM is a numerical optimization package that finds stationary points of (possibly **nonconvex**) quadratic programs, that is 
```
minimize        ½ xᵀQx + qᵀx

subject to      l ≤ Ax ≤ u
```

## Documentation

The documentation can be found at: <https://kul-optec.github.io/QPALM/Doxygen>  
Examples are included as well: <https://kul-optec.github.io/QPALM/Doxygen/examples.html>

## Installation

### Python

The QPALM Python interface is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qpalm),
you can install it using:
```sh
python3 -m pip install qpalm
```

### Julia

In the Julia console, press `]` to enter the Pkg REPL and install QPALM using:
```sh
add QPALM
```

### Matlab

To install the Matlab interface, download
`qpalm-matlab-{linux,windows,macos}.zip` from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/kul-optec/QPALM/releases/latest), and 
extract it into the `~/Documents/MATLAB` folder.  
As a one-liner in the Matlab console:
```matlab
unzip('https://github.com/kul-optec/QPALM/releases/download/1.1.3/qpalm-matlab-linux.zip', userpath)
```
```matlab
unzip('https://github.com/kul-optec/QPALM/releases/download/1.1.3/qpalm-matlab-windows.zip', userpath)
```
```matlab
unzip('https://github.com/kul-optec/QPALM/releases/download/1.1.3/qpalm-matlab-macos.zip', userpath)
```

### C/C++/Fortran

Pre-built C, C++ and Fortran libraries are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/kul-optec/QPALM/releases).

### Building QPALM from source

For detailed instructions on how to build QPALM from source, please see 
<https://kul-optec.github.io/QPALM/Doxygen/installation-md.html>

## Supported platforms

QPALM is written in C, with interfaces for C++, Python, Julia, Matlab and Fortran.  
The code itself is portable across all major platforms. Binaries are available
for Linux on x86-64 and AArch64<sup>*</sup> and for Windows and macOS on x86-64.

<sup>(*) Except Matlab.</sup>
