"""
This class defines an object (Portfolio) for keeping track of our current investments and profits/losses for each currency pair.
The class provides five methods for each currency pair either buy currency units, sell currency units, calculate the
current profit/loss, calculate the balance of the pair and close the trade.

Assumption for HWK 3: there is always enough money of the needed currency to do the desired transaction
