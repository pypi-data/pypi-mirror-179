    Classic implementation of reader-writer lock with preference to writers.

    Readers can access a resource simultaneously.
    Writers get an exclusive access.

    API is self-descriptive:
        reader_enters()
        reader_leaves()
        writer_enters()
        writer_leaves()

    Usage:
    firstly, define a global RWLock variable such as lock.
    Secondly, run :
        with lock.reader(),  or
        with lock.writer()
