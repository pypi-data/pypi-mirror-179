# unknown-numbers

**How do you use?**

```python
from package_name.alpha_term import *

# In this way, you can use every class on the package.
```

**How do you install this package?**
```
pip install unknown-terms
```

**Quick Note: If you don't want this project as a 
package you had to change this lines in alpha_term.py** 

`from .multiple_alpha_term import MultipleAlphaTerm`

`from .printer import TermPrinter`

**to**
 
`from multiple_alpha_term import MultipleAlphaTerm`

`from printer import TermPrinter`

**What does this repo do?**

This repo allows you to create exponential terms using unknown numbers comfortably. You can do various math applications using this repository. Like binomial expansion, derivative, integral...

```python
term1 = AlphaTerm(2, "x", 2)  # That means 2x²

print(term1.get_coefficient()) # 2.0
print(term1.get_alpha()) # 'x'
print(term1.get_exponent()) # 2
print(term1.get_printable_exponent()) # ²

print(term1) # Irregular -> 2.0x²
print(TermPrinter.print(term1)) # Regular 2x²

```


AlphaTerm class has multiple methods. 

```python
term1 = AlphaTerm(2, "x", 2)  # That means 2x²
term2 = term1 * 4 # That means 8x²
term3 = term2 ** 2  # That means 64x⁴
term4 = term1 * term2 * term3  # That means 1024x⁸
term5 = term4 / 8  # That means 128x⁸
```

_What if the alphas are different ?_ The answer is in the **MultipleAlphaTerm** class.

```python
term1 = AlphaTerm(3, "a", 4)
term2 = AlphaTerm(4, "b", 5)
m_term = term1 * term2  # This expression returns MultipleAlphaTerm(term1, term2)

print(m_term) # 12.0a⁴b⁵
print(TermPrinter.print(m_term)) # 12a⁴b⁵

```

- _NOT: Operations such as exponentiation, division, multiplication can also be applied to objects in the MultipleAlpaTerm class._
