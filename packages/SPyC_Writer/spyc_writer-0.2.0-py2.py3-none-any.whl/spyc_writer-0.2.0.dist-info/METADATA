# SPyC_Writer
A writer for the Thermo Galactic SPC file format, written in Python. Only outside library used is numpy. 
The remainder of libraries used all come from the python standard library.
Other outside libraries are used for testing, but the core module does not use them.

The module has been cross validated using https://github.com/rohanisaac/spc and [spectragryph](https://www.effemm2.de/spectragryph/)
by parsing the output file and verifying it matches what is expected.

Validation has been done on Y, XY, XYYY, and XYXYXY file types. All instances were successfully parsed.
[Wiley's Know It All](https://sciencesolutions.wiley.com/knowitall-spectroscopy-software/) was used also for validating and
it successfully parsed all formats except XYXYXY, which it states is invalid.

## Tests
Tests are written using pytest and verified using https://github.com/rohanisaac/spc. This package appears to not
have been updated in a while and contains a few errors, but it provides a straight forward interface in python for verifying
parsing.

## To-Do
- Widen support for other SPC aspects that are currently listed as unsupported
	- Allow old file format
	- Provide option for not writing as IEEE float
	- etc.
- Troubleshoot why KIA considers XYXYXY formats invalid
- Expand tests
- Expand input validation and provide informative error messages for wrong input
