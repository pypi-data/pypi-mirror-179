Description
-----------

This package is a product of my PhD scripting needs.
It is not meant to be (for now) a proper python package with as
few bugs as possible and reaching compatibility in a lot of ecosystems.
However, I am continually updating it and making more and more clear documentation,
therefore you could find some inspiration on my code to create your own scripts,
(as well as I did on many other codes to create **Palmiche**).

Nevertheless, all your ideas and suggestions are very welcome and for sure I will take them into account to improve **Palmiche**.

What for?
~~~~~~~~~

**Palmiche** is a group of scripts that could be used for Molecular Dynamic simulations (launch and analysis), docking and other chemoinformatic operations.
The idea is automate the whole pipeline and improve productivity and transferability.
