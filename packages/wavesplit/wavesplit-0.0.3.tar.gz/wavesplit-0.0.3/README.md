<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

wavesplit is a package for merging multiple wav files together and then
splitting them later based on the perserved lengths. It enables you to
perform any sort of operation on the merged file before splitting back
to the original clips.

Requires you to have `sox` installed from <https://sox.sourceforge.net/>

## Install

`pip install wavesplit`

## How to use

Simply input the wav files using `wavesplit` or `wavemerge`

`wavesplit merged.wav merged.txt`

Or

`wavemerge *.wav`

Which will output `merged.txt` and `merged.wav`
