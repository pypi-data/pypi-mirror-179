6. How to debug and test your Flutter app in the iOS simulator without a Mac
============================================================================

Debugging and testing your iOS app is fairly easy with Appollo. **Even if you do not have a Mac**.

For this tutorial, you will have to start a build with a **configuration build type**. Why use a configuration build type ?
This is because this build type allows you to connect to the Appollo-Remote with the Spice protocol used previously in
the tutorial.

So, type in ``appollo build start`` in your terminal and enter **configuration**.

Let Appollo start the build, and wait a few minutes for the build to end. Once finished you can connect to the Appollo-Remote
with ``appollo build connect``.

Complete the given information within your remote desktop application to access the Appollo-Remote.

.. note::
    For this step, you need a remote desktop access application. In this tutorial, the one used is **Spice-Space's** |spice_client|.

    Launch your software, it is named RemoteViewer on your computer, indicate the **url** your were given and connect.

Once you are on the Appollo-Remote, you can launch the simulator.

It might take some time to boot if it is the first time you are using it.

In parallel, you can also start an instance of the terminal on the Appollo-Remote.

Go into your app using ``cd Documents/app`` and use the ``flutter run`` command.

Wait a few instants and the app should start on the simulator, you can now debug and test it.
