7. How to create an IPA file without a Mac for testing purposes on an Apple Device
==================================================================================

In this section of the tutorial, you are going to learn how to effectively build your app to retrieve the **IPA** file
for testing purposes on physical apple devices.

.. tip:: An IPA file contains an iOS app. It is a file that can be installed on iOS devices and used as an application.
         It is comparable to an Android APK.

Adding your device to Apple Developer
-------------------------------------
IPA files can be used for testing purposes only if the physical devices on which you want to test them are added to the
Apple Developer Devices.

To register a new device, visit |apple_device| and add a new device.

You will need the UDID of the apple device on which you want to install your app. You can get the UDID by browsing
to `udid.tech <https://udid.tech/>`_ with your apple device. Or you can get your UDID
`directly from itunes <https://whatsmyudid.com/>`_ when your device is plugged in.

Once your device has been registered we can start building the IPA.

Building the IPA
----------------
You can use the command ``appollo build start`` but this time the **build type** is going to be **ad-hoc**.

Your build is being created. Grab a coffee, it can take a few minutes.

.. note:: The previously used build type ``configuration`` for the XCode configuration does not generate an IPA file.

.. tip:: If you add ``--help`` you will see all the different options you have to configure your build. For example,
         you can choose the build version.

.. tip::
    If you closed your terminal while your app was building you can always check the status with ``appollo build detail``
    and selecting your last build in the list.

Builds do not stop if the ``appollo build start`` command is killed.

Your build can have different status, here they are in order:

1. Created: Your build was created but the remote instance has not started yet

2. In progress:

  a. Starting instance: The Appollo-Remote instance is booting up

  b. Preparing build: Loading the different certificates

  c. Building: Your app is being created

  d. Getting build result: The patch is created as well as the IPA file

  e. Publishing: Sending app on the app store

3. Succeeded

When your build has succeeded, you can use the command ``appollo build ipa``

You will be given a URL. If you use it in a browser, it will download the file.

You can also send the URL to a **registered device** of your Apple developer account to download the app, for example by e-mail.
When clicking this link directly from your Apple device a prompt will be shown to install the application on your device.

And that is how you can build your app for testing purposes on physical devices.

.. tip:: To register a new device, visit |apple_device|.

.. warning:: For the device to be used, it must be registered **before** you make the build. Otherwise,
             you will not be able to install the app.
