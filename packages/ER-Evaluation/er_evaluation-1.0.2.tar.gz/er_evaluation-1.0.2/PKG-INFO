# ðŸ”Ž ER-Evaluation: An End-to-End Evaluation Framework for Entity Resolution Systems

**ER-Evaluation** is a Python package for the evaluation of entity resolution (ER) systems. It provides data structure definitions, summary statistics, visualizations, error analysis tools, and statistically principled performance estimators.

## Installation

Install the released version from PyPI using:
```bash
pip install er-evaluation
```

## Documentation

Please refer to the documentation website [olivierbinette.ca/er-evaluation](http://olivierbinette.ca/er-evaluation/build/html/index.html).

## Acknowledgements

**ER-Evaluation** is an extension of the [PatentsView/PatentsView-Evaluation](https://github.com/PatentsView/PatentsView-Evaluation/) project sponsored by the American Institutes for Research and the U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office. We aim to provide a unified source of evaluation tools for entity resolution systems which are maintained as an open source academic project.
