# yfinance-cache
Caching wrapper for yfinance module. Intelligent caching, not dumb caching of web requests:
- If requested data not in cache, `yfinance` is called
- If all requested data is in cache, return that
- If some in cache but some missing, ask `yfinance` for the missing data

Additional logic decides if cached data needs refresh.

## Interface
Interaction is almost identical to yfinance. Differences are highlighted underneath code:

```python
import yfinance_cache as yf

msft = yf.Ticker("MSFT")

# get stock info
msft.info

# get historical market data
hist = msft.history(period="max")
...
# etc. See yfinance documentation for full API
```

#### Refreshing cache
```python
msft = yf.Ticker(interval="1d", max_age=datetime.timedelta(hours=1), ...)
```
`max_age` controls when to refresh cached data to avoid spam. If market is still open and `max_age` time has passed since last fetch, then today's cached price data will be refreshed. 
Defaults to half of interval. Refresh also triggered if market closed since last fetch.

#### Adjusting price
Price can be adjusted for stock splits, dividends, or both. `yfinance` only allows control of dividends adjustment via `auto_adjust`. How Yahoo adjusts for dividends is slightly mysterious so djusted prices are slightly different to Yahoo (tiny relative error ~1e-7)
```python
msft = yf.Ticker(..., adjust_splits=True, adjust_divs=True)
```

## Installation

Available on PIP: `pip install yfinance_cache`

## Known issues / pending tasks

- Considering adding a 'verify' function, checking all cached data against Yahoo.
- Add refresh check to financials data, then to earnings dates.

## Limitations

Code is being actively developed so some features missing:

- only price data is checked if refresh needed
- `Tickers` class and `download()` not available - use `Ticker.history()`
- pre/post price data not available
