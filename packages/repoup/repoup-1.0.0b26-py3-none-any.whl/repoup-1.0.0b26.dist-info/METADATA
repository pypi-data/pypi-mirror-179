Repoup is a utility to manage packages repositories stored on the cloud from serverless
functions. For instance, it can manage an RPM repository stored on S3 from an AWS lambda
function.

Features:

 * Repository initialization.
 * Packages addition and deletion.
 * Packages signature.
 * Multiple repository management with a single instance.
 * Autodetection of the repository to update based on the package name information 
   (Architecture, OS version, package format).

Supported repositories:

 * RPM: `.rpm` packages repositories used with DNF/YUM Linux package managers.
 * DEB: `.deb` packages repositories used with APT Linux package managers.

Supported cloud:

 * AWS: AWS S3 (or compatible) as storage with optional Cloudfront CDN. 
   AWS Lambda as repository updater.

# Installation

The package is available on PyPI and can be installed using Pip:

```bash
pip install repoup
```

By default, only the minimum dependencies are installed. It is possible to install
more dependencies using the following extras:

* `speedups`: Optional libraries to improve performance.
* `rpm`: RPM repositories support.
* `deb`: DEB repositories support.
* `aws`: AWS cloud provider support.

For instance:

```bash
pip install repoup[rpm,speedups]
```

For DEB repositories, the `python-apt` package is also recommended to improve 
performance. The version of this package available on PyPI is really outdated, so it is
recommended to use the version packaged with your OS. Ensure the Python interpreter used
is the system interpreter in this case or that it can import this package.

## Packages and metadata signature extra requirements:

The `gnupg` (Version 2.1 or more) command is required.

GPG keys with passwords also requires that the `gpg-agent` is not already started or is 
started with the `--allow-preset-passphrase` parameter.

### RPM packages

To sign RPM package, the `rpm-sign` package is required.

#### Signature verification

If the repository is called with `gpg_verify=True` to activate signature verification
after signing, the `rpm` command require to be run as Root. This is required to add 
and remove the public key to the keyring.

It is possible to set the `RPM_GPG_REQUIRE_SUDO=1` environment variable to 
automatically use `sudo`. This requires that `sudo` does not require password.

### DEB Packages.

To sign DEB package, the `debsigs` package is required.
