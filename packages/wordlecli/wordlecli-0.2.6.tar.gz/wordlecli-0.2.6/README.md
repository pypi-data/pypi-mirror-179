### ❖ Installation

> Install from pip
```sh
$ pip3 install wordlecli
```

> Install from source
- First, install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dotzenith/wordle-cli.git
$ cd wordle-cli
$ poetry build
$ pip3 install ./dist/wordlecli-0.2.6.tar.gz
```

### ❖ Usage 

Playing wordle in the command-line is as simple as running the following command:

```sh

```

But if your addiction to wordle needs more, you can also play an older wordle by specifying it's number

```sh
$ wordle 240
```

The on-screen keyboard can be turned off using the `--hard` option

```sh
$ wordle --hard
```
