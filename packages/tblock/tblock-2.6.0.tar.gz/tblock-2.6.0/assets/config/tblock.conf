[hosts]
# Change the way the hosts file is built by TBlock
# NOTE: You need to rebuild your hosts file with `tblock -H` for these changes to apply

# Change the default IPv4 redirecting address for blocked domains
default_ip = 0.0.0.0

# Allow IPv6 rules and IPv6-based blocking
# WARNING: this will cause your hosts file to be twice as big as before
allow_ipv6 = false

# Change the default IPv6 redirecting address for blocked domains
# This will only be used if `allow_ipv6` is set to `true`
default_ipv6 = ::1


[policy]
# Change the default permissions to give to different filter lists
# Use A to give Allowing permission, B to give Blocking permission, and R to give Redirecting permission
# Multiple permissions can be given by concatenating them together (i.e. Allowing + Blocking => AB)
# NOTE: This will not affect filter lists you are already subscribing to

# WARNING: it is highly discouraged to give the Redirecting permission to all filter lists here. 
# Instead, it should rather be made manually by using `tblock -M`
# More information here: https://tblock.codeberg.page/docs/faq.html#why-isnt-it-recommended-to-let-filter-lists-to-set-redirecting-rules-by-default

# Default permissions for filter lists that are available in the repository index
regular = AB

# Default permissions for custom filter lists
custom = AB


[daemon]
# Change the behavior of the daemon
# NOTE: You need to restart the daemon for these changes to apply

# Sync the repository when updating filter lists (recommended)
sync_repo = true

# How often the filter lists should be updated (value expressed in hours)
# The minimum value accepted is 3 hours. If a lower value is specified,
# it will automatically switch to the default value (12 hours)
# The value MUST BE an integer: decimals aren't supported and the default value will be used instead.
frequency = 12

# Force-update filter lists (this is usually not needed)
force = false

# Detect changes made to the hosts file by other programs/others and overwrite them
