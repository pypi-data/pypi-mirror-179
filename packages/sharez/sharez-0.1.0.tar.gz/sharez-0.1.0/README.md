# sharez

sharez allows to share directories to your local network from your terminal.

This is basically a copy of [parvardegr/sharing](https://github.com/parvardegr/sharing), but written in Python. Also, it's less advanced. I kept it as simple as possible.

## Installation

```sh
pip install sharez
```

## Usage

```sh
sharez <directory_path>
```

Use `sharez -h` for more details.
