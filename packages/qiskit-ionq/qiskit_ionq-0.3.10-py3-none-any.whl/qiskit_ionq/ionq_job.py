"""IonQ's Job implementation.

.. NOTE::
   IonQ job status names are slightly different than those of the standard
   :class:`JobStatus <qiskit.providers.JobStatus>` enum values.

   As such, the :meth:`IonQJob.status` method on the IonQJob class attempts to
   perform a mapping between these status values for compatibility with
