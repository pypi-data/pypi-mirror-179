Tutorial
========

Now that you learned what is meant with model validation you can play around with *Dymoval*.
The best way to take familiarity with *Dymoval* is to run any tutorial by typing 

.. code-block::

    import dymoval as dmv
    dmv.open_tutorial()

This will copy the :code:`dymoval_tutorial.ipynb` jupyter notebook from your installation folder to your :code:`home` folder.
