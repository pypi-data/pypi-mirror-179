        I really like using Markdown.
        
        I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.
        
        This is the first line.  
        And this is the second line.
        
        I just love **bold text**.  
        I just love __bold text__.  
        Love**is**bold  
        Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.  
        
        Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.  
        A*cat*meow  
        
        This text is ***really important***.
