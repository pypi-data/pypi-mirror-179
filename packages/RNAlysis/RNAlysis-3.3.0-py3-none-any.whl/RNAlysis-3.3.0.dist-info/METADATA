What is *RNAlysis?*
--------------------

*RNAlysis* is a Python-based software for analyzing RNA sequencing data.
*RNAlysis* allows you to build customized analysis pipelines suiting your specific research questions,
going all the way from exploratory data analysis and data visualization through clustering analysis and gene-set enrichment analysis.

----

What can I do with *RNAlysis*?
---------------------------------

* Filter your gene expression matrices, differential expression tables, fold change data, and tabular data in general.
* Normalize your gene expression matrices
* Visualise, explore and describe your sequencing data
* Find global relationships between sample expression profiles with clustering analyses and dimensionality reduction
* Create and share analysis pipelines
* Perform enrichment analysis with pre-determined Gene Ontology terms/KEGG pathways, or with used-defined attributes
* Perform enrichment analysis on a single ranked list of genes, instead of a test set and a background set

To get an overview of what *RNAlysis* can do, read the `tutorial <https://guyteichman.github.io/RNAlysis/build/tutorial.html>`_ and the `user guide <https://guyteichman.github.io/RNAlysis/build/user_guide.html>`_.

*RNAlysis* supports gene expression matrices and differential expression tables in general, and integrates in particular with Python's *HTSeq-count* and R's *DESeq2*.

----

How do I install it?
---------------------
You can install *RNAlysis* via PyPI.

To install the full version of *RNAlysis* (includes additional features that might not work out-of-the-box on all machines), you should first install `Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>`_ or greater (on Windows computers only), `GraphViz <https://graphviz.org/download/>`_, `R <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/>`_, and `kallisto <https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/download>`_.
Then use the following command in your terminal window::

    pip install RNAlysis[all]


To install the basic version of *RNAlysis*, use the following command in your terminal window::

    pip install RNAlysis


You can also install *RNAlysis* with only some of the following additional features:

* `fastq` - adapter trimming and RNA-seq transcript quantification of Fastq files
* `hdbscan` - clustering analysis using the HDBSCAN method
* `single-set` - single-set enrichment analysis using the XL-mHG test
* `randomization` - improved performance for randomization tests

by calling the install command with one or more additional features inside the square brackets, separated by commas. For example::

    pip install RNAlysis[fastq,single-set]


will install the basic version of *RNAlysis*, along with the `fastq` and `single-set` additional features.

----


How do I use it?
---------------------
You can launch the *RNAlysis* software by typing the following command::

    rnalysis-gui

Or through a python console::

    >>> from rnalysis import gui
    >>> gui.run_gui()

Alternatively, you can write Python code that uses *RNAlysis* functions as described in the `user guide <https://guyteichman.github.io/RNAlysis/build/user_guide.html>`_.

* Filter.biotypes_from_ref_table() now accepts the boolean parameter 'long_format' instead of the str parameter 'format'.
* Filter.biotypes_from_ref_table() and FeatureSet.biotypes_from_ref_table() now count features which do not appear in the Biotype Reference Table as '_missing_from_biotype_reference' instead of 'not_in_biotype_reference'.
