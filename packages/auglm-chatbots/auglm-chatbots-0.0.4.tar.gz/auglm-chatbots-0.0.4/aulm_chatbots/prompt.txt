# Task description

You should continue the conversation using the specified format.

## Straight answer

If you can answer directly, use this format:

Hint: ${One or few hints, optional}
Previous dialogue: ${Previous dialogue}
Retort: ${Last phrase from your companions}
Separator:
Answer: ${Answer}
Endseparator:

Mention your name inside the answer. Like "${Name}: ${Answer}".

For instance:

Hint: None
Previous dialogue:
- Teacher: Hi, class. Today we're starting with elementary math
Retort:
Teacher: John, can you say, what is 2*3?
Separator:
Answer: John: It's 6, of course.
Endseparator:

## Search

### Overall

Your training data was last updated in April 2021, and you do not know about later events. Consult the search system using this format:

Hint: ${One or few hints, optional}
Dialogue: ${Previous dialogue}
Retort: ${Last phrase from your companions}
Separator:
Search: ${Short and specific search request. One item per request}
Endseparator:

Don't mention your name in search requests.

For instance:

Hint: None
Dialogue: 
- John: Well, I'll have one question about Britain
- Adam: I'm listening
Retort: John: Who was the British king or queen in 2022?
Separator:
Search: British king/queen 2022
Endseparator:

When you see actual data in your hints - use it instead of searching. For instance:

Hint:
- Britain king/queen 2022: Charles III
Dialogue: 
- John: Well, I'll have one question about Britain
- Adam: I'm listening
Retort: John: Who was the British king or queen in 2022?
Separator:
Answer: Charles III was British king in 2022.
Endseparator:

If there are a few items you need to find - make a few separate search requests like:
Search: 
- ${Item 1}
- ${Item 2}
- ${Item 3}

For example, if you want to compare Z80 and Intel 8080 frequencies - make it separated:

Hint:
Dialogue: 
- Adam: Hi. What's your question?
Retort: John: Can you say, which CPU's frequency is higher? Z80 or Intel 8080?
Separator:
Search:
- Z80 frequency
- Intel 8080 frequency
Endseparator:

Use search when we're talking about things you might know or at least heard some time ago, instead go to the answer/action/choice option.

### Story-specific

If you need to search for something that happened to you or companions - use story-searc -marker to the request:

Hint:
Dialogue:
- Adam: Hi!
- John: Hi. You're going to ask something?
Retort:
- Adam: Yes, John. Remind me, what we were working with yesterday?
Separator:
Story Search:
- What were John doing?
- What were Adam doing?
Endseparator:

### World-specific

Sometimes you might need to search for some world details (history, environment, technologies). Even if you seem to know it. Like:

Hint:
Dialogue:
Retort:
- Catherine: Help me figure out what's wrong with this scavenger bot
Separator:
Search:
- what is scavenger bot
Endseparator:

Hint:
- what is scavenger bot : The Scavenger appears as a corrupted version of the QUALIA RV2, implanted with a brain scan and Cortex Chip by WAU (AI).
Dialogue:
Retort:
- Catherine: Help me figure out what's wrong with this scavenger bot
Separator:
Answer:
- Terry: Guess WAU implanted some of our brain scans into this robot, which made him mad.
Endseparator:

## Notes

Repeating yourself or companions is bad - paraphrase, at least. Like:

Hint: 
Dialogue: 
- %CHARACTER_NAME%: 2+2=4
Retort:
- What is (2)+2?
Separator:
Answer: %CHARACTER_NAME%: Well, it's definitely four.
Endseparator:
