How to install
==============

The Autosubmit code is maintained in *PyPi* and git, the main source for python packages.

- Pre-requisites: bash, python3, sqlite3, git-scm > 1.8.2, subversion, dialog, curl, python-tk(tkinter in centOS), graphviz >= 2.41, pip3

.. important:: (SYSTEM) Graphviz version must be >= 2.38 except 2.40(not working). You can check the version using dot -v.

- Python dependencies: configobj>=5.0.6, argparse>=1.4.0 , python-dateutil>=2.8.2, matplotlib==3.4.3, numpy==1.21.6, py3dotplus>=1.1.0, pyparsing>=3.0.7, paramiko>=2.9.2, mock>=4.0.3, six>=1.10,  portalocker>=2.3.2, networkx==2.6.3, requests>=2.27.1, bscearth.utils>=0.5.2, cryptography>=36.0.1, setuptools>=60.8.2, xlib>=0.21, pip>=22.0.3, ruamel.yaml, pythondialog, pytest, nose, coverage, PyNaCl==1.4.0, six>=1.10.0, requests, xlib, Pygments, packaging==19, typing>=3.7, autosubmitconfigparser

.. important:: dot -v command should contain "dot",pdf,png,svg,xlib  in device section.

.. important:: The host machine has to be able to access HPC's/Clusters via password-less ssh. Make sure that the ssh key is in PEM format `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@email.com" -m PEM`.


To install autosubmit just execute:
::

    pip install autosubmit

or download, unpack and:
::

    python3 setup.py install

.. hint::
    To check if autosubmit has been installed run ``autosubmit -v.`` This command will print autosubmit's current
    version

.. hint::
    To read autosubmit's readme file, run ``autosubmit readme``

.. hint::
    To see the changelog, use ``autosubmit changelog``

How to configure
================

After installation, you have to configure database and path for Autosubmit.
In order to use the default settings, just create a directory called `autosubmit` in your home directory before running the configure command.
The experiments will be created in this folder, and the database named `autosubmit.db` in your home directory.

::

    autosubmit configure




For advanced options you can add ``--advanced`` to the configure command. It will allow you to choose different directories (they must exist) for the experiments and database,
as well as configure SMTP server and an email account in order to use the email notifications feature.


::

    autosubmit configure --advanced


.. hint::
    The ``dialog`` (GUI) library is optional. Otherwise the configuration parameters
    will be prompted (CLI). Use ``autosubmit configure -h`` to see all the allowed options.


For installing the database for Autosubmit on the configured folder, when no database is created on the given path, execute:
::

    autosubmit install

.. danger:: Be careful ! autosubmit install will create a blank database.

Lastly, if autosubmit configure doesn't work for you or you need to configure additional info create:

Create or modify /etc/autosubmitrc file or ~/.autosubmitrc with the information as follows:

.. code-block:: ini

    database:
    path: path to autosubmit db
    filename: autosubmit.db

    local:
    path: path to experiment folders

    conf:
    jobs: path to any experiment  jobs conf # If not working on esarchive, you must create one from scratch check the how to.
    platforms: path to any experiment  platform conf # If not working on esarchive, you must create one from scratch check the how to.

    mail:
    smtp_server:mail.bsc.es
    mail_from:automail@bsc.es

    structures:
    path:   path to experiment folders

    globallogs:
    path:   path to global logs (for expid,delete and migrate commands)

    historicdb:
    path: <experiment_folder>/historic

    autosubmitapi:
    url:  url of Autosubmit API (The API is provided inside the BSC network)
    # Autosubmit API provides extra information for some Autosubmit functions. It is not mandatory to have access to it to use Autosubmit.

    hosts:
    authorized:  [run bscearth000,bscesautosubmit01,bscesautosubmit02] [stats,clean,describe,check,report,dbfix,pklfix,updatedescript,updateversion all]
    forbidden:  [exp√¨d,create,recovery,delete,inspect,monitor,recovery,migrate,configure,setstatus,testcase,test,refresh,archive,unarchive bscearth000,bscesautosubmit01,bscesautosubmit02]


Hosts:
From 3.14+ onwards, autosubmit commands can be tailored to run on specific machines. Previously, only run was affected by the deprecated whitelist parameter.
 * authorized: [<command1,commandN> <machine1,machineN>] list of machines that can run given autosubmit commands.
 * forbidden:  [<command1,commandN> <machine1,machineN>] list of machines that cannot run given autosubmit commands.
 * If no commands are defined, all commands are authorized.
 * If no machines are defined, all machines are authorized.

Now you are ready to use Autosubmit !
