# AoC Utils

This small library can be used for the yearly Advent of Code
(https://adventofcode.com) challenge. It automates the retrieval of puzzle input
and submission.

# Usage

``` python
from aocutil import Aoc

# Initialize for year 2022, day 1 with session id 53616c746
#
# Everything here is optional. If left out year and day is determined
# from the current date -- be aware that your code is non-repeatable if year 
# and date is not specified.
# Session id is read from `${HOME}/.config/aocutil/session_id` if not specified.
aoc = Aoc(year=2022, day=1, session_id="53616c746")

# Retrieve input and split into list of lines
#
# You can also retrieve the content as a string with `aoc.input().read()`.
puzzle = aoc.input().lines()

# solve the puzzle (your implementation)
solution = solve(puzzle)

# Submit the solution for level 1
#
# If left out, the level is determined automatically by
# which level is not solved yet.
aoc.submit(solution, level=1)
```

# Retrieving the Session ID

A user in Advent of Code submissions and input retrieval is determined by a
session id stored in a cookie in the user's browser. For this library to work it
needs a users session id. The session id can be found by opening your browsers
developer tools and looking for a cookie named `session`.

You can either initialize `Aoc` with the token or store it in a file named
`${HOME}/.config/aocutil/session_id`. I would recommend the latter so you don't
accidentially publish your session id. Note that everyone who gets hold of your
session id can impersonate you.
