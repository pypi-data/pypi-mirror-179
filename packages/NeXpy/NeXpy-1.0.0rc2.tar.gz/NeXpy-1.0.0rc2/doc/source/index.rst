NeXpy: A Python GUI to analyze NeXus data
=========================================

NeXpy provides a high-level python interface to HDF5 files, particularly those
stored as `NeXus data <http://www.nexusformat.org/>`_, within a simple GUI. It 
is designed to provide an intuitive interactive toolbox allowing users both to 
access existing NeXus files and to create new NeXus-conforming data structures 
without expert knowledge of the file format. The underlying Python API for 
reading and writing NeXus files is provided by the `nexusformat 
<https://github.com/nexpy/nexusformat>`_ package, which utilizes 
`h5py <http://www.h5py.org/>`_. The Python API is also described here.

.. note:: NeXpy v0.14.7 is now available for `download 
          <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/NeXpy/>`_ or on conda-forge (`Release 
          Notes <https://github.com/nexpy/nexpy/releases>`_). This is a 
          beta-release so please post any issues that you encounter on the 
          `NeXpy GitHub <https://github.com/nexpy/nexpy/issues>`_.
