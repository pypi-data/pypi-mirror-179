Only a concrete database implementation package such as\n[sqlite-historian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) that depends on this library can be\ninstalled as a VOLTTRON agent.\n\n## Requirements\n\n - Python >= 3.8\n\n## Installation\n\nThis library can be installed using ```pip install volttron-lib-sql-historian```. However, this is not necessary. Any\nhistorian agent that uses this library will automatically install it as part of its installation. For example,\ninstalling [SQLiteHistorian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) will automatically install\nvolttron-lib-sql-historian\n\n## Development\n\nPlease see the following for contributing guidelines [contributing](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nPlease see the following helpful guide about [developing modular VOLTTRON agents](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core/blob/develop/DEVELOPING_ON_MODULAR.md)\n\nTo create a new relational database based historian by extending this library, subclass\n[DBDriver](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-lib-sql-historian/blob/develop/src/historian/sql/basedb.py#L79).\nThe subclass should be in a module historian.<database_type>.<database_type>functs.py for it to be dynamically loaded\nby the base DBDriver.
