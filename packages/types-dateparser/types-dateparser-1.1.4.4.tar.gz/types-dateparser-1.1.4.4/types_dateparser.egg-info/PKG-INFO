## Typing stubs for dateparser

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `dateparser` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `dateparser`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/dateparser. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `c6b9b4ce85d4432639eb146e6f03806b08128a5a`.
