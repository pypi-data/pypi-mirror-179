# paradeps

## Overview

This resolves dependencies into parallelizable execution tiers.  For example, given the inputs:

    a, b, c, d, f

Where a and b depend on f, this will return:

    [{c,d,f}, {a,b}]


## Requirements

Python 3.10+


## Installation

    pip install paradeps

Or download the *.whl files and install it with `pip install *.whl`.


## Usage

    from paradeps import Dependent

    class Item(Dep):
       ...

    def process_items_in_parallel(items):
       ...

    items = [Item() for i in range(5)]

    items[0].add_dependency(items[2])
    items[2].add_dependency(items[4])

    tiers = resolve_deps(items)

    for tier in tiers:
        process_items_in_parallel(tier)
