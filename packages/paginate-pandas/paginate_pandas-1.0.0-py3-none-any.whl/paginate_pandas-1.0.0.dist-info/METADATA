A dead-simple interactive paginator for a pandas Series or DataFrames that leverages on ipywidgets and works beautifully on Jupyter Lab. It let's you easily browse through a possibly big (say, hundreds of thousands of rows) dataframe advancing page by page. It also let's you control the page size. If you deal with pandas a lot in Jupyter, this will change your quality of (developer) life.
