Given a list of integers as the Abelian charges of fermions, check if there is a scalar which which can generate Yukawa couplings and non-zero masses for all them after the SSB-

## Install
```bash
$ pip install yukawa
```
## USAGE
```python
>>> from yukawa import yukawa
>>> yukawa.get_massive_fermions(l,s)
[(x,y),...]
```
