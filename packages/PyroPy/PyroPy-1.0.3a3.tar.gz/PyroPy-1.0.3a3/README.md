# PyroPy
Analysis of fire spread and intensity.

Author: Geoffysicist

Source code: [https://github.com/Geoffysicist/PyroPy](https://github.com/Geoffysicist/PyroPy)

Uses weather data and model specific parameters to predict rate of spread and
intensity of wildfires.

Unless otherwise indicated all models have been taken from:
> Cruz, Miguel, James Gould, Martin Alexander, Lachie Mccaw, and 
Stuart Matthews. (2015) *A Guide to Rate of Fire Spread Models for Australian 
Vegetation*, CSIRO Land & Water and AFAC, Melbourne, Vic 125 pp. 


## Install
```
pip install PyroPy
```

## Included modules
 - `firebehaviour`: Defines the main `Incident` class and several auxillary 
        dictionaries. An `Incident` stores data related to the incident 
        including weather, model parameters and model outputs.
 - `spreadmodels`: fire spread model functions which can be called directly or 
        by an `Incident`.
 - `weatherdata`: functions for reading, writing and transforming weather 
        between various formats including Australian Bureau of Meteorology 
        (BoM) Gridded Weather, BoM Observations (*.axf) and Amicus.

## Typical Use Example
```python
from pyropy import firebehaviour as fb
from pyropy import weatherdata as wd

#read the weather data into a pandas DataFrame
weather_fn = 'weather_gridded_in.csv'
weather_df = wd.gridded_to_df(weather_fn)

#create an Incident using the weather data
incident = fb.Incident(weather_df)

#add the parameters necessary to run the desired models
incident_params = {
    #forest_mk5
    'waf': 3.5,
    'fuel_load': 15,
    #forest_vesta
    'fhs_surf': 3.5,
    'fhs_n_surf': 2,
    'fuel_height_ns': 20
}
incident.set_params(incident_params)

#run the desired models
incident.run_forest_mk5()
incident.run_forest_vesta()

#output results
incident.print(head=True)
```
